Deep Learning using Pseudo-Inverse Matrix Multiplications

## TODO:
[] Complete CNN implementation
[] Update visuals for experiments
[] ensure hidden weights for kernels are converted to 2D (not 3D) - otherwise if you use a different batch size for X it wont work!
[] allow for K CNN kernels to be trained (not just 1)
[] extend CNN for 2d image layers
