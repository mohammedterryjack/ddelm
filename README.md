# Alternative Deep Learning: Back-Projection of the Pseudo-Inverse of Targets

## TODO:
[] compare models on various classification tasks
[] plot classifications as scatter with colours expected and predicted (https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-classification-plot-classifier-comparison-py)
[] extend CNN for 2d image layers
[] compare cnn on various image classification tasks
[] allow for K CNN kernels to be trained (not just 1)
