# Alternative Deep Learning: Back-Projection of the Pseudo-Inverse of Targets

## TODO:
[x] Complete CNN implementation
[x] ensure hidden weights for kernels are converted to 2D (not 3D) - otherwise if you use a different batch size for X it wont work!
[x] add labels to CNN visualisation
[x] add arrows to CNN visualisation
[] allow for K CNN kernels to be trained (not just 1)
[] extend CNN for 2d image layers
[] Update visuals for experiments
